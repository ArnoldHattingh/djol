# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: November 9, 2025_

This Privacy Policy explains how **CliDash** (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards information when you use our websites, mobile apps, and related services (collectively, the “Services”).

By using the Services, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

**Account & Profile**
- Name, email, role (Admin, Advisor, Assistant, Client), company affiliation, authentication identifiers.
- Passwords are stored using industry-standard hashing via our identity provider.

**Client & Business Data**
- Client profiles and custom fields, contact details, dependents, dates (e.g., birthdays/anniversaries).
- Files and documents you upload or share, document requests, and onboarding records.
- Tasks, workflows, reminders, comments, notifications, and license/billing records.

**Meetings & Audio**
- Audio recordings you initiate, transcription results, AI-generated summaries, timestamps, and related metadata.
- Local caching of pending audio on device when offline (where applicable).

**Integrations (if enabled by your organization)**
- Email headers/content for search and context (e.g., Outlook/Office 365).
- Files and folders linked from SharePoint.
- OAuth tokens and integration configuration metadata.

**Usage & Device**
- App and feature usage, log data, device information, performance metrics, cookies or similar technologies on the web app.

## 2. How We Use Information
- Provide, operate, and maintain the Services.
- Authenticate users and enforce role-based access and company-level isolation.
- Record, transcribe, and summarize meetings on your instruction.
- Enable AI-assisted chat and insights using context you supply.
- Manage tasks, workflows, reminders, notifications, and celebrations.
- Store, share, and merge documents as directed by you.
- Provide customer support, security monitoring, fraud prevention, and compliance.
- Improve performance, reliability, and user experience; develop new features.
- Process billing, licenses, and invoices.

## 3. Legal Bases (where applicable)
We process data to perform our contract with you or your organization, based on legitimate interests (e.g., securing and improving the Services), with your consent (e.g., optional features), and to comply with legal obligations.

## 4. Sharing & Disclosure
We do **not** sell personal information. We share data only:
- **With service providers** that process data on our behalf (e.g., cloud hosting, storage, transcription and AI processing, analytics, support).
- **With integrations you enable**, such as Outlook/Office 365 and SharePoint, where data flows as directed by you or your administrator.
- **For legal reasons**, to comply with law, protect rights, safety, or security.
- **Business transfers**, in connection with a merger, acquisition, or asset sale.

## 5. Data Security
We use administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect information, including encryption in transit and at rest where supported by our providers, role-based access controls, audit logging, and secure development practices.

## 6. Data Retention
We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Organizations may configure retention for certain records. You may request deletion as described below.

## 7. Your Rights
Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, update, export, object to, or delete your personal information, and to withdraw consent where processing is based on consent. We will respond in accordance with applicable law and our role as processor or controller. If your account is managed by your organization, please contact your administrator first.

## 8. Children’s Privacy
The Services are not directed to children under the age required by applicable law, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them.

## 9. International Transfers
We may process and store information in countries other than your own. Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards for cross-border data transfers.

## 10. Organization Controls
Admins can manage users, roles, custom fields, workflows, and integrations. Enabling an integration authorizes data flows to that service under the admin’s control. Removing an integration stops new data flows; historical copies may remain with the third-party service per its policies.

## 11. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be posted with a revised “Last updated” date.
